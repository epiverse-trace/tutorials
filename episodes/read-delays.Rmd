::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: prereq

## Prerequisites

This episode requires you to be familiar with:

**Data science** : Basic programming with R.

**Epidemic theory** : Epidemiological parameters. Time periods.

This also requires the following package:

```r
if(!require("pak")) install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("epiverse-trace/epiparameter")
```

## Systematic review of Parameters

The [natural history](../learners/reference.md#naturalhistory) of a infectious disease shows that its development has a regularity from stage to stage. The time periods from a infectious disease inform about the timing of transmission and interventions.

::::::::::::::::: callout

### Definitions

Take a look at the [glossary](../learners/reference.md) for the definitions of all the time periods of the figure above!

:::::::::::::::::::::::::

However, early in an epidemic, modelling efforts can be delayed by the lack of a centralized resource that summarized input parameters for the disease of interest ([Nash et al., 2023](https://mrc-ide.github.io/epireview/)). Projects like `{epiparameter}` and `{epireview}` are building online catalogs that can help building models faster for coming outbreaks and epidemics from known and unknown pathogens related to known families of viruses.

<!-- Early models for COVID-19 used parameters from other coronaviruses. -->

Let's explore how we can access to time periods and delays using `{epiparameter}` to plug them in to `{EpiNow2}`:

```{r}
library(epiparameter)
library(EpiNow2)
library(tidyverse)
```


## Find a generation time

The generation time, jointly with the $R$, can inform about the speed of spread and its feasibility of control. Given a $R>1$, with a shorter generation time, cases can appear more quickly.

![From the video by MRC Centre for Global Infectious Disease Analysis, Ep 76. Science In Context - Epi Parameter Review Group with Dr Anne Cori (27-07-2023) at <https://youtu.be/VvpYHhFDIjI?si=XiUyjmSV1gKNdrrL>](fig/reproduction-generation-time.png)

In calculating the effective reproductive number ($Rt$), the generation time distribution is often approximated by the [serial interval](../learners/reference.md#serialinterval) distribution.
This is because the date of onset of symptoms is more easily observed than the date of onset of infectiousness.

<!-- This can produced biased estimates. ([Knight et al., 2020](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2468042720300634?via%3Dihub)) -->

However, this is valid for diseases in which infectiousness starts after symptom onset [(Chung Lau et al. 2021)](https://academic.oup.com/jid/article/224/10/1664/6356465). In cases where infectiousness starts before symptom onset serial intervals can be negative! This is the case of a pre-symptomatic transmission.

Even if the generation time and serial interval have the same mean, their variance usually differ propagating bias to the Rt estimation. Rt estimates are sensitive not only to the mean generation time but also to the variance and form of the generation interval distribution [(Gostic et al., 2020)](https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1008409).

### REVIEW

Let's assume that COVID-19 and SARS has similar Reproduction number values, and the Serial interval a good proxy of the generation interval. 

Given the Serial interval of both infections in the figure below: 

- Which one would be harder to control? 
- Why do you conclude that?

![Serial interval of novel coronavirus (COVID-19) infections overlaid with a published distribution of SARS. From [Nishiura et al, 2020](https://www.ijidonline.com/article/S1201-9712(20)30119-3/fulltext)](fig/serial-interval-covid-sars.jpg)

::::::::::::::::: hint

### HINT

The peak of each curve can inform you about the location of the mean of each distribution. The larger the mean, the larger the serial interval. 

::::::::::::::::::::::

::::::::::::::::: solution

### SOLUTION

Which one would be harder to control?

- COVID-19

Why do you conclude that?

- COVID-19 has the lowest mean serial interval. The approximate mean value for the serial interval of COVID-19 is around 4 days, and SARS is around 7 days. Thus, COVID-19 is likely to have newer generations in less time than SARS, assuming similar reproduction number in both.

::::::::::::::::::::::::::


:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

Now, instead of using `EpiNow2::dist_spec()` to plug-in numeric values to specify the distribution as in the chunk below:

```r
generation_time <- dist_spec(
  mean = 3.6,
  sd = 3.1,
  max = 20,
  distribution = "lognormal"
)
```

Let's replace it with the Serial Interval output for COVID-19 using the `epiparameter::epidist_db()` function. (Assuming that the disease we are dealing with is COVID-19)

```{r}
epiparameter::epidist_db(
  disease = "covid",
  epi_dist = "serial",
  author = "Nishiura")
```

We have more than one epidemiological delay. To summarize this view and get the column names from the underlying parameter dataset we can connect the previous code chunk using the pipe `%>%` and the `epiparameter::list_distributions()` function:

```{r}
epiparameter::epidist_db(
  disease = "covid",
  epi_dist = "serial",
  author = "Nishiura") %>%
  epiparameter::list_distributions()
```

If we want to filter only one

```{r}
covid_lnorm <- epiparameter::epidist_db(
  disease = "covid",
  epi_dist = "serial",
  author = "Nishiura",
  single_epidist = T) # not desired

covid_lnorm

covid_lnorm$summary_stats$mean
covid_lnorm_discrete <- epiparameter::discretise(covid_lnorm)
covid_lnorm_discrete_max <- covid_lnorm_discrete$prob_dist$q(p = 0.999)

generation_time_epiparam <- dist_spec(
  mean = covid_lnorm$summary_stats$mean,
  sd = covid_lnorm$summary_stats$sd,
  max = covid_lnorm_discrete_max,
  distribution = "lognormal"
)

epinow_estimates <- epinow(
  # cases
  reported_cases = example_confirmed[1:60],
  # delays
  generation_time = generation_time_opts(generation_time_epiparam),
  # computation
  stan = stan_opts(
    cores = 4, samples = 1000, chains = 3,
    control = list(adapt_delta = 0.99)
  )
)

base::plot(epinow_estimates)
```

# if not, find serial interval and use it as serial interval
```

The natural history of a disease influence the transmission dynamics. For `{EpiNow2}`, we can specify relevant delay distributions like the [incubation period](../learners/reference.md#incubation):
