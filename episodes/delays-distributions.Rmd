## Introduction

Delays are key for downstream task in outbreak analytics. To estimate the outbreak severity, we need to assume a known delay from onset to death. To quantify transmission, we need to consider delays from the moment of infection to the time of data collection.
In order to account for _epidemiological delays_ when estimating indicators of severity or transmission, in our analysis we need to input delays as **Probability Distributions**.

Let's start by loading the package `{dplyr}` to manipulate data. We'll use the pipe `%>%` to connect some of their functions, including others from the package `{ggplot2}`, so let's call to the package `{tidyverse}` that loads them all. We will also use `{fitdistrplus}` to fit probability distributions to delays:

```{r}
# Load packages
library(tidyverse) # loads dplyr, the pipe, and ggplot2
library(fitdistrplus)
```

```{r,echo=FALSE,message=FALSE,warning=FALSE}
# Load packages
library(tidyverse) # loads readr, dplyr, tidyr and ggplot2

# Set seed for reproducibility
set.seed(33)

# Read data
cases <- simulist::sim_linelist(outbreak_size = c(1000, 1500)) %>%
  as_tibble() %>%
  dplyr::select(id, date_onset, date_admission) %>%
  dplyr::mutate(diff_onset_to_admission = date_admission - date_onset) %>%
  dplyr::mutate(
    diff_onset_to_admission_num = as.numeric(diff_onset_to_admission)
  ) %>%
  dplyr::filter(diff_onset_to_admission_num > 0)

# reporting delay
diff_fit <- cases %>%
  dplyr::pull(diff_onset_to_admission_num) %>%
  fitdistrplus::fitdist(distr = "lnorm")

cases %>%
  ggplot() +
  geom_histogram(
    aes(x = diff_onset_to_admission_num, y = ..density..),
    binwidth = 1
  ) +
  stat_function(
    fun = dlnorm,
    args = list(
      meanlog = diff_fit$estimate["meanlog"],
      sdlog = diff_fit$estimate["sdlog"]
    ),
    color = "red",
    size = 1.2
  ) +
  labs(
    x = "Days from onset to admission",
    y = "Density",
    title = "Histogram with Lognormal PDF Overlay"
  ) +
  theme_minimal()
```


::::::::::::::::::: checklist

**The double-colon**

The double-colon `::` in R let you call a specific function from a package without loading the entire package into the current environment. 

For example, `dplyr::filter(data, condition)` uses `filter()` from the `{dplyr}` package.

This helps us remember package functions and avoid namespace conflicts.

## Fit a probability distribution to delays

::::::::::::::::::: instructor

Assess learners based on video refreshers on distributions, likelihood, and maximum likelihood from setup instructions.

:::::::::::::::::::

We fit a probability distribution to data (like delays) to make inferences about it. These inferences can be useful for Public health interventions and decision making. For example:

- From the [incubation period](reference.md#incubation) distribution we can inform the length of active monitoring or quarantine. We can infer the time by which 99% of infected individuals are expected to show symptoms ([Lauer et al., 2020](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32150748/)).

- From the [serial interval](reference.md#serialinterval) distribution we can optimize contact tracing. We can evaluate the need to expand the number of days pre-onset to consider in the contact tracing to include more backwards contacts ([Claire Blackmore, 2021](https://www.paho.org/sites/default/files/backward_contact_tracing_v3_0.pdf); [Davis et al., 2020](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/61e9ab3f8fa8f50597fb3078/S0523_Oxford_-_Backwards_contact_tracing.pdf)).

**From time periods to probability distributions**

When we calculate the *serial interval*, we see that not all case pairs have the same time length. We will observe this variability for any case pair and individual time period.

![Serial intervals of possible case pairs in (a) COVID-19 and (b) MERS-CoV. Pairs represent a presumed infector and their presumed infectee plotted by date of symptom onset ([Althobaity et al., 2022](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2468042722000537#fig6)).](fig/serial-interval-pairs.jpg)

To summarise these data from individual and pair time periods, we can find the **statistical distributions** that best fit the data ([McFarland et al., 2023](https://www.eurosurveillance.org/content/10.2807/1560-7917.ES.2023.28.27.2200806)).

<!-- add a reference about good practices to estimate distributions -->

![Fitted serial interval distribution for (a) COVID-19 and (b) MERS-CoV based on reported transmission pairs in Saudi Arabia. We fitted three commonly used distributions, Log normal, Gamma, and Weibull distributions, respectively ([Althobaity et al., 2022](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2468042722000537#fig5)).](fig/seria-interval-fitted-distributions.jpg)

Statistical distributions are summarised in terms of their **summary statistics** like the *location* (mean and percentiles) and *spread* (variance or standard deviation) of the distribution, or with their **distribution parameters** that inform about the *form* (shape and rate/scale) of the distribution. These estimated values can be reported with their **uncertainty** (95% confidence intervals).

| Gamma | mean | shape | rate/scale |
|:--------------|:--------------|:--------------|:--------------|
| MERS-CoV | 14.13(13.9–14.7) | 6.31(4.88–8.52) | 0.43(0.33–0.60) |
| COVID-19 | 5.1(5.0–5.5) | 2.77(2.09–3.88) | 0.53(0.38–0.76) |

| Weibull | mean | shape | rate/scale |
|:--------------|:--------------|:--------------|:--------------|
| MERS-CoV | 14.2(13.3–15.2) | 3.07(2.64–3.63) | 16.1(15.0–17.1) |
| COVID-19 | 5.2(4.6–5.9) | 1.74(1.46–2.11) | 5.83(5.08–6.67) |

| Log normal | mean | mean-log | sd-log |
|:--------------|:--------------|:--------------|:--------------|
| MERS-CoV | 14.08(13.1–15.2) | 2.58(2.50–2.68) | 0.44(0.39–0.5) |
| COVID-19 | 5.2(4.2–6.5) | 1.45(1.31–1.61) | 0.63(0.54–0.74) |

:::::::::::::::::::::::::

Let's start by simulating a line list using `{simulist}`:

```{r}
# Set seed for reproducibility
set.seed(33)

# Read data
cases <- simulist::sim_linelist(outbreak_size = c(1000, 1500)) %>%
  as_tibble()
```

From the `cases` object we can use:

- `dplyr::mutate()` to transform the `reporting_delay` class object from `<time>` to `<numeric>`,
- `dplyr::filter()` to keep the positive values,
- `dplyr::pull()` to extract a single column,
- `fitdistrplus::fitdist()` to fit a probability distribution using Maximum Likelihood. We can test distributions like the Log Normal (`"lnorm"`), `"gamma"`, or `"weibull"`.

```{r}
reporting_delay_fit <- cases %>%
  dplyr::select(id, date_onset, date_admission) %>%
  dplyr::mutate(reporting_delay = date_admission - date_onset) %>%
  dplyr::mutate(reporting_delay_num = as.numeric(reporting_delay)) %>%
  dplyr::filter(reporting_delay_num > 0) %>%
  dplyr::pull(reporting_delay_num) %>%
  fitdistrplus::fitdist(distr = "lnorm")

reporting_delay_fit
```

Use `summary()` to find goodness-of-fit statistics from the Maximum likelihood. Use `plot()` to visualize the fitted density function and other quality control plots. To compare multiple distributions you can use [`superspreading::ic_tbl()`](https://epiverse-trace.github.io/superspreading/reference/ic_tbl.html). We'll explore that package later!

Now we can do inferences from the probability distribution fitted to the epidemiological delay! Want to learn how? Read the "Show details" :)

:::::::::::::::: spoiler

**Making inferences from probability distributions**

From probability distributions we can infer estimates like cumulative probability, maximum values, or generate random values. We can access to them using R probability functions.

We recommend you read the definitions of the [R probability functions for the Normal distribution](https://sakai.unc.edu/access/content/group/3d1eb92e-7848-4f55-90c3-7c72a54e7e43/public/docs/lectures/lecture13.htm#probfunc). From it we can relate with any other family of statistical distributions!

![The four probability functions for the normal distribution ([Jack Weiss, 2012](https://sakai.unc.edu/access/content/group/3d1eb92e-7848-4f55-90c3-7c72a54e7e43/public/docs/lectures/lecture13.htm#probfunc))](fig/fig5a-normaldistribution.png)

Each probability distribution has a unique set of **parameters** and **probability functions**. Read the [Distributions in the stats package](https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/stats/html/Distributions.html) or `?stats::Distributions` to find the ones available in R.

For example, assuming that the reporting delay follows a **Log Normal** distribution, we can use `plnorm()` to calculate the probability of observing a reporting delay of 14 days or less:

```{r}
plnorm(q = 14, meanlog = 1.0488098, sdlog = 0.8465102)
```

Or the amount of time by which 99% of symptomatic individuals are expected to be reported in the hospitalization record:

```{r}
qlnorm(p = 0.99, meanlog = 1.0488098, sdlog = 0.8465102)
```

You will find more examples of how to use delays for decision-making at the **Use delay distributions in analysis** at Tutorials Middle!

To interactively explore probability distributions, their parameters and access to their distribution functions, we suggest to explore a shinyapp called **The Distribution Zoo**: <https://ben18785.shinyapps.io/distribution-zoo/>

::::::::::::: checklist

Let's review some operators used until now:

- Assignment `<-` assigns a value to a variable from right to left.
- Double colon `::` to call a function from a specific package.
- Pipe `%>%` to structure sequences of data operations left-to-right
<!-- - Logical negation `!` to indicate a logical negation (NOT). -->

We need to add two more to the list: 

- Dollar sign `$`
- Square brackets `[]`

:::::::::::::

Last step is to access to this parameters. Most modeling outputs from R functions will be stored as `list` class objects. In R, the dollar sign operator `$` is used to access elements (like columns) within a data frame or list by name, allowing for easy retrieval of specific components.

::::::::::::::: tab

### Get elements from list

Let's assign to `reporting_delay_fit` the output of an statistical model fitting a distribution to data.

```{r}
reporting_delay_fit <- cases %>%
  dplyr::select(id, date_onset, date_admission) %>%
  dplyr::mutate(reporting_delay = date_admission - date_onset) %>%
  dplyr::mutate(reporting_delay_num = as.numeric(reporting_delay)) %>%
  dplyr::filter(reporting_delay_num > 0) %>%
  dplyr::pull(reporting_delay_num) %>%
  fitdistrplus::fitdist(distr = "lnorm")
```

Usually, statistical outputs in R are stored as `List` class objects. Run the chunk below to explore it:

```{r,eval=FALSE,echo=TRUE}
reporting_delay_fit %>%
  str()
```

You can use `purrr::pluck()` to safely get an element deep within a nested data structure.

```{r,eval=FALSE}
reporting_delay_fit %>%
  purrr::pluck("estimate")
```

The code below provides an equivalent result, and can provide more fluency when writing your code:

```{r,echo=TRUE}
reporting_delay_fit$estimate
```

But, how do you access to one specific parameter?

### Get elements from column

<!-- this usage is secondary in tutorials -->

Let's assign to `cases_delay` the filtered data frame with positive values for the observed reporting delays.

```{r}
cases_delay <- cases %>%
  dplyr::select(id, date_onset, date_admission) %>%
  dplyr::mutate(reporting_delay = date_admission - date_onset) %>%
  dplyr::mutate(reporting_delay_num = as.numeric(reporting_delay)) %>%
  dplyr::filter(reporting_delay_num > 0)
```

We can use `dplyr::pull()` to extract a single column:

```{r}
cases_delay %>%
  dplyr::pull(reporting_delay_num)
```

The code below provides an equivalent result. Try this yourself:

```{r,eval=FALSE,echo=TRUE}
cases_delay$reporting_delay_num
```

:::::::::::::::

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: testimonial

**A code completion tip**

If we write the **square brackets** `[]` next to the object `reporting_delay_fit$estimate[]`, within `[]` we can use the 
Tab key <kbd>↹</kbd> 
for [code completion feature](https://support.posit.co/hc/en-us/articles/205273297-Code-Completion-in-the-RStudio-IDE) 

This gives quick access to `"meanlog"` and `"sdlog"`. We invite you to try this out in code chunks and the R console!

```{r,eval=FALSE,echo=TRUE}
# 1. Place the cursor within the square brackets
# 2. Use the Tab key
# 3. Explore the completion list
# 4. Select for "meanlog" or "sdlog"
reporting_delay_fit$estimate[]
```

**Estimating epidemiological delays is CHALLENGING!**

Epidemiological delays need to account for biases like censoring, right truncation, or epidemic phase ([Charniga et al., 2024](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1012520)). 
 
Additionally, at the beginning of an outbreak, limited data or resources exist to perform this during a real-time analysis. Until we have more appropriate data for the specific disease and region of the ongoing outbreak, we can **reuse delays from past outbreaks** from the same pathogens or close in its phylogeny, independent of the area of origin.

:::::::::::::::

In the following tutorial episodes, we will:

<!-- - Efficiently clean and produce **epidemic curves** to explore patterns of disease spread by difference group and time aggregates. Find more in [Tutorials Early](https://epiverse-trace.github.io/tutorials-early/)! -->
- Access to epidemiological **delay distributions** to estimate delay-adjusted transmission and severity metrics (e.g. reproduction number and case fatality risk). Find more in [Tutorials Middle](https://epiverse-trace.github.io/tutorials-middle/)!
- Use parameter values like the basic reproduction number, and **delays** like the [latent period](reference.md#latent) and [infectious period](reference.md#infectiousness) to simulate transmission trajectories and intervention scenarios. Find more in [Tutorials Late](https://epiverse-trace.github.io/tutorials-late/)!

## Challenges

:::::::::::::::::::::::: challenge

<!-- summative assessment -->

**Relevant delays when estimating transmission**

- Review the definition of the [incubation period](reference.md#incubation) in our glossary page.

- Calculate the summary statistics of the incubation period distribution observed in the line list.

- Visualize the distribution of the incubation period from the line list.

- Fit a log-normal distribution to get the probability distribution parameters of the the observed incubation period.

- (Optional) Infer the time by which 99% of infected individuals are expected to show symptoms.

::::::::::::: solution

Calculate the summary statistics:

```{r}
cases %>%
  dplyr::select(case_id, date_of_infection, date_of_onset) %>%
  dplyr::mutate(incubation_period = date_of_onset - date_of_infection) %>%
  skimr::skim(incubation_period)
```

Visualize the distribution:

```{r,warning=FALSE,message=FALSE}
cases %>%
  dplyr::select(case_id, date_of_infection, date_of_onset) %>%
  dplyr::mutate(incubation_period = date_of_onset - date_of_infection) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = incubation_period)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 1)
```

Fit a log-normal distribution:

```{r}
incubation_period_dist <- cases %>%
  dplyr::select(case_id, date_of_infection, date_of_onset) %>%
  dplyr::mutate(incubation_period = date_of_onset - date_of_infection) %>%
  mutate(incubation_period_num = as.numeric(incubation_period)) %>%
  filter(!is.na(incubation_period_num)) %>%
  pull(incubation_period_num) %>%
  fitdistrplus::fitdist(distr = "lnorm")

incubation_period_dist
```

(Optional) Infer the time by which 99% of infected individuals are expected to show symptoms:

```{r}
qlnorm(
  p = 0.99,
  meanlog = incubation_period_dist$estimate["meanlog"],
  sdlog = incubation_period_dist$estimate["sdlog"]
)
```

With the distribution parameters of the incubation period we can infer the length of active monitoring or quarantine. 
[Lauer et al., 2020](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32150748/) estimated the incubation period of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) from publicly reported confirmed cases.
