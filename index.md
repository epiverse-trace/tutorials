## Epiverse-TRACE tutorials

The Epiverse-TRACE tutorials are training materials for outbreak analysis aimed at [learners](../profiles.md) without extensive backgrounds and experience in modelling. 

The tutorials are built around the workflow of outbreak analysis split into three stages : early tasks, middle tasks and late tasks.

![An overview of the tutorial topics](https://epiverse-trace.github.io/task_pipeline-minimal.svg)


Task topics consist of one or more episodes. You can navigate to different episodes using the menu on the left hand side. Alternatively, check out the [key points](../key-points.md) of each episode.

Within each episode there are:

+ **Overview** : describes what questions will be answered and what are the objectives of the episode.
+ **Prerequisites**: describes what episodes/packages need to be covered before the current episode.
+ **Example R code** : work through the episodes on your own computer using the example R code.
+ **Challenges** : complete challenges to test your understanding.
+ **Explainers** : add to your understanding of mathematical and modelling concepts with the explainer boxes.

Also check out the [glossary](../reference.md) for any terms you may be unfamiliar with.
