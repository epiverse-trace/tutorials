We support the development of R packages, make the existing ones interoperable for the user experience, and stimulate a community of practice. In the outbreak analytics curriculum, we built three tutorials around an outbreak analysis pipeline split into three stages: Early, Middle, and Late tasks. Early tasks include reading and cleaning case data and accessing delay distributions to estimate transmission metrics. Middle tasks include estimating forecasting, severity and superspreading from case data and simulating transmission chains. Late tasks include scenario modelling to simulate disease spread and investigate interventions.},
