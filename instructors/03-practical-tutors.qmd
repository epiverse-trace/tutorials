# Practical

This practical has two activities.

## Activity 1: Account for superspreading

Estimate the extent of individual-level variation (i.e. the dispersion parameter) of the offspring distribution, which refers to the variability in the number of secondary cases per individual, and assess the implications for variation in transmission for decision-making using the following available inputs:

- Line list of cases
- Contact tracing data

**Steps:**

Open the file `03-practical-activity-1.R` and fill in all the `#<COMPLETE>` lines following the `steps:` detailed in the R file.

Within your room, Write your answers to these questions:

- From descriptive and estimation steps:
    - Which set has more infections related to fewer clusters in the contact network?
    - What set has the most skewed histogram of secondary cases?
    - Does the estimated dispersion parameter correlate with the contact network and histogram of secondary cases?
- On decision making:
    - What is the probability of new cases originating from a cluster of at least 10 cases?
    - Would you recommend a backward contact tracing strategy?
- Interpret: How would you communicate these results to a decision-maker?
- Compare: What differences do you identify from other room outputs? (if available)

```r
#>     R    k prop_5 prop_10 prop_25
#> 1 0.8 0.01  95.1%   89.8%   75.1%
#> 2 0.8 0.10  66.7%   38.7%	7.6%
#> 3 0.8 0.50  25.1%	2.8%  	  0%
```

#### Interpretation

Interpretation template:

- Two valid alternatives, For R = 0.8 and k = 0.01:
    - The probability of new cases originating from a cluster of 5 cases or more is 95%.
    - The proportion of all transmission events that were part of secondary case clusters (i.e., from the same primary case) of at least 5 cases is 95%.

Interpretation Helpers:

+ From the contact network, set 1 has the highest frequency of infections related with a small number of clusters (four major clusters out of all the transmission events).
+ From the histogram of secondary cases, skewness in set 1 is higher than set 2 and set 3.
+ Set 1 has cases with the highest number of secondary cases (n = 50), compared with set 2 (n = ~25) and set 3 (n = 11).
+ The contact networks and histograms of secondary cases correlate with the estimated dispersion parameters: A small number of clusters generating most of new cases produces a more skewed histogram, and a lowest estimate of dispersion parameter.
+ About probability of new cases from transmission cluster of size at least 10 cases, and the recommending backward tracing strategy:
    + set 1: 89%, yes.
    + set 2: 38%, probably no?
    + set 3: 3%, no.

## Activity 2: Simulate transmission chains

Estimate the potential for large outbreaks that could occur based on 1000 simulated outbreaks with one initial case, using the following available inputs:

- Basic reproduction number
- Dispersion parameter

**Steps:**

Open the file `03-practical-activity-2.R` and fill in all the `#<COMPLETE>` lines following the `steps:` detailed in the R file.

Within your room, Write your answers to these questions:

- You have been assigned to explore `Chain ID`. From the output data frame, describe:
   - How many generations does this chain have?
   - The story of this chain: Who infected whom, and when (with reference to the day of infection).
- Among simulated outbreaks:
    - How many chains reached a 100-case threshold?
    - What is the maximum size among all the chains?
    - What is the maximum length among all the chains? (in days)
- Interpret: How would you communicate these results to a decision-maker?
- Compare: What differences do you identify from other room outputs? (if available)

### Inputs

| Room | Parameters | Chain ID |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | R = 0.8, k = 0.01 | 957 |
| 2 | R = 0.8, k = 0.1 | 281 |
| 3 | R = 0.8, k = 0.5 | 38 |
| 4 | R = 1.5, k = 0.01 | 261 |
| 5 | R = 1.5, k = 0.1 | 325 |
| 6 | R = 1.5, k = 0.5 | 591 |

#### Interpretation

Interpretation template:

+ Simulated chain `957` have 1 unknown infector `ID = NA`, 2 known infectors `ID = c(1, 10)`, and 3 generations.
+ In the generation 1, subject `ID = NA` infected subject `ID = 1`.
+ In the generation 2, subject `ID = 1` infected 12 subjects `IDs from 2 to 13`. These infections occurred between day 2 and 6 after the first infection (initial case).
+ In the generation 3, subject `ID = 10` infected subjects `ID = c(14, 15, 16)`. These infections occurred between day 4 and 7 after the first infection (initial case).

Interpretation Helpers:

From the plot of cumulative cases by day for each simulated chain:

| Room | Parameters | Number of Chains Above 100 | Max Chain Size | Max Chain Length |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | R = 0.8, k = 0.01 | 10 | ~200 | ~20 days |
| 2 | R = 0.8, k = 0.1 | 8 | ~420 | ~60 days |
| 3 | R = 0.8, k = 0.5 | 3 | ~180 | ~70 days |
| 4 | R = 1.5, k = 0.01 | 16 | ~840 | ~20 days |
| 5 | R = 1.5, k = 0.1 | 65 | ~890 | ~50 days |
| 6 | R = 1.5, k = 0.5 | 216 | ~850 | ~90 days |
