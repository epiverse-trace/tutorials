- <https://epiverse-trace.github.io/tutorials-middle/superspreading-estimate.html>
- <https://epiverse-trace.github.io/tutorials-middle/superspreading-simulate.html>

# Practical

This practical has two activities.

## Activity 1: Account for superspreading

Estimate the extent of individual-level variation (i.e.Â the dispersion
parameter) of the offspring distribution, which refers to the
variability in the number of secondary cases per individual, and assess
the implications for variation in transmission for decision-making using
the following available inputs:

- Line list of cases
- Contact tracing data

**Steps:**

Open the file `03-practical-activity-1.R` and fill in all the
`#<COMPLETE>` lines following the `steps:` detailed in the R file.

Within your room, Write your answers to these questions:

- From descriptive and estimation steps:
  - Does the estimated dispersion parameter correlate with the contact
    network and histogram of secondary cases?
- On decision making:
  - What is the probability of new cases originating from a cluster of
    at least 10 cases?
  - Would you recommend a backward contact tracing strategy?
- Interpret: How would you communicate these results to a
  decision-maker?
- Compare: What differences do you identify from other room outputs? (if
  available)
  - Which room has more infections related to fewer clusters in the
    contact network?
  - What room has the most skewed histogram of secondary cases?
  - Is there a relationship between contact network clusters, histogram
    of secondary cases, and dispersion parameter estimates?

#### Code

##### Room 1 (sample)

``` r
# nolint start

# Practical 3
# Activity 1

# step: fill in your room number
room_number <- 1 #valid for all

# Load packages -----------------------------------------------------------
library(epicontacts)
library(fitdistrplus)
library(tidyverse)


# Read linelist and contacts ----------------------------------------------
# step: Paste the URL links as a string to read input data.

dat_contacts <- readr::read_rds(
  "https://epiverse-trace.github.io/tutorials-middle/data/set-01-contacts.rds"  #<DIFFERENT PER ROOM>
)

dat_linelist <- readr::read_rds(
  "https://epiverse-trace.github.io/tutorials-middle/data/set-01-linelist.rds"  #<DIFFERENT PER ROOM>
)


# Create an epicontacts object -------------------------------------------
# step: Create a *directed* contact network 
# using the linelist and contacts data inputs.
# Paste a screenshot of the network in the report.

epi_contacts <- epicontacts::make_epicontacts(
  linelist = dat_linelist,
  contacts = dat_contacts,
  directed = TRUE
)

# Print output
epi_contacts

# Visualize the contact network
contact_network <- epicontacts::vis_epicontacts(epi_contacts)

# Print output
contact_network


# Count secondary cases per subject in contacts and linelist --------------
# step: Calculate the *out-degree* for each node (infector case)
# in the contact network, using *all* the cases observed in the linelist.
# Paste the output histogram in the report.

secondary_cases <- epicontacts::get_degree(
  x = epi_contacts,
  type = "out",
  only_linelist = TRUE
)

# Plot the histogram of secondary cases
individual_reproduction_num <- secondary_cases %>%
  enframe() %>% 
  ggplot(aes(value)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 1) +
  labs(
    x = "Number of secondary cases",
    y = "Frequency"
  )

# Print output
individual_reproduction_num


# Fit a negative binomial distribution -----------------------------------
# step: Use the vector with the number of secondary cases per infector case 
# to fit a Negative Binomial distribution using {fitdistrplus}
# Paste the output parameters in the report.

offspring_fit <- secondary_cases %>%
  fitdistrplus::fitdist(distr = "nbinom")

# Print output
offspring_fit


# Estimate proportion of new cases from a cluster of secondary cases ------
# step: Use {superspreading} to calculate the probability (proportion)
# of new cases originating from a cluster of a given size (cluster size),
# using as input the offspring distribution parameters: 
# the reproduction number and dispersion.
# Paste the output result in the report.

# Set seed for random number generator
set.seed(33)

# Estimate the probability of new cases originating from 
# a transmission cluster of at least 5, 10, or 25 cases
proportion_cases_by_cluster_size <- 
  superspreading::proportion_cluster_size(
    R = offspring_fit$estimate["mu"],
    k = offspring_fit$estimate["size"],
    cluster_size = c(5, 10, 25)
  )

# Print output

#>     R    k prop_5 prop_10 prop_25
#> 1 0.8 0.01  95.1%   89.8%   75.1%
#> 2 0.8 0.10  66.7%   38.7%    7.6%
#> 3 0.8 0.50  25.1%    2.8%      0%
```

#### Interpretation

Interpretation template:

- Two valid alternatives, For R = 0.8 and k = 0.01:
  - The probability of new cases originating from a cluster of 5 cases
    or more is 95%.
  - The proportion of all transmission events that were part of
    secondary case clusters (i.e., from the same primary case) of at
    least 5 cases is 95%.

Interpretation Helpers:

- From the contact network, room 1 has the highest frequency of
  infections related with a small number of clusters (four major
  clusters out of all the transmission events).
- From the histogram of secondary cases, skewness in room 1 is higher
  than room 2 and room 3.
- Room 1 has cases with the highest number of secondary cases (n = 50),
  compared with room 2 (n = ~25) and room 3 (n = 11).
- The contact networks and histograms of secondary cases correlate with
  the estimated dispersion parameters: A small number of clusters
  generating most of new cases produces a more skewed histogram, and a
  lowest estimate of dispersion parameter.
- About probability of new cases from transmission cluster of size at
  least 10 cases, and the recommending backward tracing strategy:
  - room 1: 89%, yes.
  - room 2: 38%, probably no?
  - room 3: 3%, no.

## Activity 2: Simulate transmission chains

Estimate the potential for large outbreaks that could occur based on
1000 simulated outbreaks with one initial case, using the following
available inputs:

- Basic reproduction number
- Dispersion parameter

**Steps:**

Open the file `03-practical-activity-2.R` and fill in all the
`#<COMPLETE>` lines following the `steps:` detailed in the R file.

Within your room, Write your answers to these questions:

- You have been assigned to explore `Chain ID`. From the output data
  frame, describe:
  - How many generations does this chain have?
  - The story of this chain: Who infected whom, and when (with reference
    to the day of infection).
- Among simulated outbreaks:
  - How many chains reached a 100-case threshold?
  - What is the maximum size among all the chains?
  - What is the maximum length among all the chains? (in days)
- Interpret: How would you communicate these results to a
  decision-maker?
- Compare: What differences do you identify from other room outputs? (if
  available)

### Inputs

| Room | Parameters        | Chain ID |
|------|-------------------|----------|
| 1    | R = 0.8, k = 0.01 | 957      |
| 2    | R = 0.8, k = 0.1  | 281      |
| 3    | R = 0.8, k = 0.5  | 38       |
| 4    | R = 1.5, k = 0.01 | 261      |
| 5    | R = 1.5, k = 0.1  | 325      |
| 6    | R = 1.5, k = 0.5  | 591      |

#### Interpretation

Interpretation template:

- Simulated chain `957` have 1 unknown infector `ID = NA`, 2 known
  infectors `ID = c(1, 10)`, and 3 generations.
- In the generation 1, subject `ID = NA` infected subject `ID = 1`.
- In the generation 2, subject `ID = 1` infected 12 subjects
  `IDs from 2 to 13`. These infections occurred between day 2 and 6
  after the first infection (initial case).
- In the generation 3, subject `ID = 10` infected subjects
  `ID = c(14, 15, 16)`. These infections occurred between day 4 and 7
  after the first infection (initial case).

Interpretation Helpers:

From the plot of cumulative cases by day for each simulated chain:

| Room | Parameters | Number of Chains Above 100 | Max Chain Size | Max Chain Length |
|----|----|----|----|----|
| 1 | R = 0.8, k = 0.01 | 10 | ~200 | ~20 days |
| 2 | R = 0.8, k = 0.1 | 8 | ~420 | ~60 days |
| 3 | R = 0.8, k = 0.5 | 3 | ~180 | ~70 days |
