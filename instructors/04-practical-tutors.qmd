# Practical

This practical has three activities.

## Activity 1: Generate disease trajectories across age groups

Generate disease trajectories of **infectious individuals** and **new infections** across age groups using the following available inputs:

- Social contact matrix
- Age group of the infectious population
- Disease parameters (basic reproduction number, pre infectious period, infectious period)

Within your room, Write your answers to these questions:

- What are the time and size of the epidemic peak for *infectious individuals* in each age group?
- Compare and describe the similarities and differences between these two outputs: the table with epidemic peak of *infectious individuals* across age groups, and the plot of *new infections* across age groups.
- Compare: What differences do you observe compared to the outputs from other rooms (if available)?

### Inputs

| Room | Country | Survey Link |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Italy | <https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3874557> |
| 2 | Vietnam | <https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3874802> |
| 3 | Zimbabwe | <https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3886638> |

| Parameter | Value | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Age Limits | 0, 20, 40 | Age group cutoffs |
| Infectious Population | 1 / 1,000,000 | 1 infectious individual per million people in Age group 20-40 |

#### Outputs

```
# Get epidemic_peak
epidemics::epidemic_peak(data = simulate_baseline)
# Output:
#   demography_group compartment  time    value
#             <char>      <char> <num>    <num>
# 1:           [0,20)  infectious   320 513985.6
# 2:          [20,40)  infectious   328 560947.2
# 3:              40+  infectious   329 932989.6
```

#### Interpretation

Interpretation template:

+ In the population, the demographic group of `age from [0,20]` has a peak of infectious individuals at day 320 with a size of `513,986`.

Compare output types:

+ `epidemics::epidemic_peak(data = simulate_baseline)`
    + The table output gives exact values for time and size of peak for *infectious individuals*.
+ `epidemics::new_infections(data = simulate_baseline)`
    + We can not get exact value for time and size of peak of *new infections*.
    + We can make qualitative comparisons.
+ Comparing plots:
    + The peak size of *new infections* is lower than the peak size of *infectious individuals*.
    + Both plot trajectories seem to share the time of peak.
    + Other packages that can estimate trend of new infections are `{EpiNow2}` and `{epichains}`.

## Activity 2: Compare the baseline scenario with a single intervention

Compare the disease trajectories of **new infections** in the whole population with those under an intervention, using the following available inputs:

- Time to start the intervention
- Duration of the intervention
- Type of intervention (on contacts, on transmission rate, or vaccination)
- Reduction effect or rate of vaccination

Within your room, write your answers to these questions:

- Does the impact of the intervention, compared to the baseline, align with your expectations? Why or why not? Use all the available outputs.
- Interpret the results: How would you explain these findings to a decision-maker?
- Compare: What differences do you observe compared to the outputs from other rooms (if available)?

### Inputs

| Room | Country | Survey Link |
|---|---|---|
| 1,2,3 | Zimbabwe | <https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3886638> |

| Room | Intervention | Reduction/Vaccination rate | Time begin (day) | Duration (days) |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | School closure | Age 0–19: 0.5; Age 20+: 0.01 | 200 | 250 |
| 2 | Mask mandate | All ages: 0.163 | 200 | 250 |
| 3 | Vaccination | All ages: 0.001 | 200 | 250 |

### Solution

<!-- visible for instructors and learners after practical (solutions) -->

#### Outputs

| Intervention | Early start (day 100) | Late start (day 200) |
|---|---|---|
| **School Closure** | ![image](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/HyxrKNWDee.png) | ![image](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/B18MFNWPll.png) |
| **Mask Mandate** | ![image](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/Hym4FEbDxl.png) | ![image](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/HknbYEbPlg.png) |
| **Vaccination** | ![image](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/r12Xt4-Dll.png) | ![image](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/Hy6xKN-vex.png) |

#### Interpretation

Interpretation Helpers:

+ School closure with short duration can delay the peak of new infections, but this will keep the same size.
+ Mask mandate of 200 days during the time of the epidemic peak can delay and reduce the size of new infections.
+ Vaccinations earlier in time will have a higher impact in reducing the size of the epidemic peak and extending its delay. Note that the effectiveness of vaccination can depend on various factors, including vaccine efficacy and timing relative to the outbreak.

| Combine interventions | Compare interventions |
|---|---|
| ![image](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/rk9cqK_CJe.png) | ![image](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/BJro5KuC1e.png) |

#### Interpretation

Interpretation Helpers:

- The combination of school closure and mask mandate can delay the epidemic peak, but will not reduce it size.
- Vaccination can sustain a reduced epidemic peak compared with mask mandate alone.

## Code

### Actiivty 1

```{r, file = "fig/04-practical-instructor-1.R", eval = FALSE}

```

### Actiivty 2

```{r, file = "fig/04-practical-instructor-2.R", eval = FALSE}

```

### Actiivty 3

```{r, file = "fig/04-practical-instructor-3.R", eval = FALSE}

```

### Additional challenge

<!-- In Activity 1

- Modify the basic reproduction number (R₀) from 1.46 to 1.1 or 3. What changes do you observe in the outputs? (increase the total simulation time if needed) -->

<!-- Modify the basic reproduction number (R₀):

| R = 1.1 | R = 3 |
|---|---|
| ![image](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/H1UupFOAyl.png) | ![image](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/ryVoat_R1l.png) |


- An epidemic with `R₀ = 1.1` has a days delayed and smaller outbreak based on  number of infections (day 1200, 9000 new infections), compared with `R₀ = 3` with an earlier and higher peak than `R₀ = 1.46` (day 100, 1,000,000 new infections). -->

In Activity 2

- How can the start time or duration of interventions affect the timing and size of the peak in *new infections*? Try changing the start time from day 200 to day 100, or the duration from 250 days to 100 days.
