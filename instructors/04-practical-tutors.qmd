# Practical

This practical has three activities.

## Activity 1: Generate disease trajectories

Generate disease trajectories of **infectious individuals** and **new infections** using the following available inputs:

- Social contact matrix
- Age group of the infectious population
- Disease parameters (basic reproduction number, pre infectious period, infectious period)

Within your room, Write your answers to these questions:

- What are the **time** and **size** of the epidemic peak for **infectious individuals** in each age group?
- Describe any differences between these two outputs: the epidemic peak of *infectious individuals* and the plot of *new infections*.
- Modify the basic reproduction number (R₀) from 1.46 to 1.1 or 3. What changes do you observe in the **time** and **size** of the peak of *new infections*?
- **Compare**: What differences do you notice compared to the outputs from other rooms (if available)?

### Inputs

| Room | Country | Survey Link |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Italy | <https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3874557> |
| 2 | Vietnam | <https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3874802> |
| 3 | Zimbabwe | <https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3886638> |

| Parameter | Value | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Age Limits | 0, 20, 40 | Age group cutoffs |
| Infectious Population | 1 / 1,000,000 | 1 infectious individual per million people in Age group 20-40 |
| Basic Reproduction Number | 1.46 | R₀ value for influenza |
| Pre-infectious Period | 3 days | Incubation before becoming infectious |
| Infectious Period | 7 days | Duration of infectiousness |
| Max Timesteps (days) | 600 | Total simulation time |

```
# Get epidemic_peak
epidemics::epidemic_peak(data = simulate_baseline)
# Output:
#   demography_group compartment  time    value
#             <char>      <char> <num>    <num>
# 1:           [0,20)  infectious   320 513985.6
# 2:          [20,40)  infectious   328 560947.2
# 3:              40+  infectious   329 932989.6
```

#### Interpretation

Interpret the **time** and **size** of peak for infectious individuals:

+ In the population, the demographic group of `age from [0,20]` has a peak of infectious individuals at day 320 with a size of `513,986`.

Differences:

+ `epidemics::epidemic_peak(data = simulate_baseline)`
    + The table output gives exact values for time and size of peak for **infectious individuals**.
+ `epidemics::new_infections(data = simulate_baseline)`
    + We can not get exact value for time and size of peak of **new infections**.
+ Comparing plots:
    + The peak size of *new infections* is lower than the peak size of *infectious individuals*.
    + Both plot trajectories seem to share the time of peak.

Modify the basic reproduction number (R₀):

| R = 1.1 | R = 3 |
|---|---|
| ![image](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/H1UupFOAyl.png) | ![image](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/ryVoat_R1l.png) |


- An epidemic with `R₀ = 1.1` has a days delayed and smaller outbreak based on  number of infections (day 1200, 9000 new infections), compared with `R₀ = 3` with an earlier and higher peak than `R₀ = 1.46` (day 100, 1,000,000 new infections).

## Activity 2: Compare interventions

Compare the disease trajectories of **new infections** against an intervention using the following available inputs:

- Time to start the intervention
- Duration of the intervention
- Type of intervention (on contacts, on transmission, or vaccination)
- Reduction effect or rate of vaccination

Within your room, write your answers to these questions:

- How does the time to start of the intervention (early/late) impact the timing and size of the peak of new infectious individuals?
- Is the observed impact of the intervention in these results expected?
- Interpret: How would you communicate these results to a decision-maker?
- **Compare**: What differences do you notice compared to the outputs from other rooms (if available)?

### Inputs

| Room | Intervention | Early Start | Late Start | Duration (days) | Effect (Reduction or Rate) |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | School | 100 | 200 | 100 | Age 0–19: 0.5; Age 20+: 0.01 |
| 2 | Mask | 100 | 200 | 200 | All ages: 0.163 |
| 3 | Vaccine | 100 | 200 | 150 | All ages: 0.001 |

### Solution

<!-- visible for instructors and learners after practical (solutions) -->

#### Outputs

| Intervention | Early start | Late start |
|---|---|---|
| **School Closure** | ![image](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/H1IKxq_A1e.png) | ![image](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/rJt8ttdA1e.png) |
| **Mask Mandate** | ![image](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/rkV2ttO0yx.png) | ![image](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/Bk8wKYOR1l.png) |
| **Vaccination** | ![image](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/rycdKYOA1e.png) | ![image](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/B1ff-9_Ckl.png) |

#### Interpretation

Interpretation Helpers:

+ School closure with short duration can delay the peak of new infections, but this will keep the same size.
+ Mask mandate of 200 days during the time of the epidemic peak can delay and reduce the size of new infections.
+ Vaccinations earlier in time will have a higher impact in reducing the size of the epidemic peak and extending its delay. Note that the effectiveness of vaccination can depend on various factors, including vaccine efficacy and timing relative to the outbreak.

## Activity 3: Combine interventions

Combine two intervention in the same simulation and compare the disease trajectories of new infections against the baseline or only one intervention. Use the intervention parameters above.

Within your room, Write your answers to these questions:

- Interpret: How would you communicate these results to a decision-maker?
- Compare: What differences do you identify from other room outputs? (if available)

### Inputs

| Room | Combine interventions | Compare against |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | School closure AND Vaccine | School closure |
| 2 | Mask mandate AND School contact | Mask mandate |
| 3 | Vaccine AND Mask mandate | Vaccine |

#### Interpretation

Interpretation Helpers:

- The combination of school closure and mask mandate can delay the epidemic peak, but will not reduce it size.
- Vaccination can sustain a reduced epidemic peak compared with mask mandate alone.
