# Practicals

The goal of the `practical.qmd` files in this folder is to host complementary challenges to solve in groups during syncronous trainings.

## Usage

One Quarto file generates:

- MD file: for instructors to study and propose edits.
- DOCX file: for learners to use during the practical session.
- HTML file: solutions to share with learners.

## Features

We are using Quarto:

- multi format <https://quarto.org/docs/output-formats/html-multi-format.html>
- contidional content <https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/conditional.html>
- self-contained HTMLs <https://quarto.org/docs/output-formats/html-basics.html#self-contained>
- includes <https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/includes.html>

With the limitation that we can not differentiate content for MD outputs. Using alternatives suggested in the following issue <https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-cli/issues/6705>.
