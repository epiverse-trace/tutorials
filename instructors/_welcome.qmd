# Read This First

<!-- visible for learners and instructors at practical -->

Instructions:

- Each `Activity` has five sections: the Goal, Questions, Inputs, Your Code, and Your Answers. 
- Solve each Activity in the corresponding `.R` file mentioned in the `Your Code` section.
- Paste your figure and table outputs and write your answer to the questions in the section `Your Answers`.
- Choose one group member to share your group's results with the rest of the participants.

During the practical, instead of simply copying and pasting, we encourage learners to increase their fluency writing R by using:

- The double-colon notation, e.g. `package::function()` to specify which package a function comes from, avoid namespace conflicts, and find functions using keywords.
- Tab key <kbd>↹</kbd> 
to [autocomplete package or function names](https://support.posit.co/hc/en-us/articles/205273297-Code-Completion-in-the-RStudio-IDE) and [display possible arguments](https://docs.posit.co/ide/user/ide/guide/code/console.html).
- [Execute one line of code](https://docs.posit.co/ide/user/ide/guide/code/execution.html) or multiple lines connected by the pipe operator (`%>%`) by placing the cursor in the code of interest and pressing the `Ctrl`+`Enter`.
- [R shortcuts](https://positron.posit.co/keyboard-shortcuts.html#r-shortcuts) to insert the pipe operator (`%>%`) using `Ctrl/Cmd`+`Shift`+`M`, or insert the assignment operator (`<-`) using `Alt/Option`+`-`.
<!-- - Get [help yourself with R](https://www.r-project.org/help.html) using the `help()` function or `?` operator to access the function reference manual. -->

If your local configuration was not possible to setup:

- Create one copy of the [Posit Cloud RStudio project](https://posit.cloud/spaces/609790/join?access_code=hPM1tIeKt5ax_Y-P0lMGVUGqzFPNH4wxkKSzXZYb).
