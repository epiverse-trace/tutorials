# Practical

<!-- visible for learners and instructors at practical -->

This practical has two activities.

Before you start, as a group:

<!-- - Create one copy of the [Posit Cloud RStudio project](https://posit.cloud/spaces/609790/join?access_code=hPM1tIeKt5ax_Y-P0lMGVUGqzFPNH4wxkKSzXZYb). -->
- Solve each activity in the corresponding `.R` file. Find the download link in the section `Your Code`.
- Paste your figure and table outputs and write your answer to the questions in the section `Your Answers`.
- Choose one person from your group to share your group's results with the rest of the participants.


During the practical, instead of simply copying and pasting, we encourage learners to increase their fluency writing R by using:

- Tab key <kbd>↹</kbd> 
for [code completion feature](https://support.posit.co/hc/en-us/articles/205273297-Code-Completion-in-the-RStudio-IDE) and [possible arguments displayed](https://docs.posit.co/ide/user/ide/guide/code/console.html). 
- The double-colon notation, e.g. `package::function()`. This notation allows you to specify which package a function comes from, avoid namespace conflicts, and find functions by using keywords.
- [R shortcuts](https://positron.posit.co/keyboard-shortcuts.html#r-shortcuts):
    - `Cmd/Ctrl`+`Shift`+`M` to Insert the pipe operator (`|>` or `%>%`)
    - `Alt`+`-` to Insert the assignment operator (`<-`)
- [Execute one line of code](https://docs.posit.co/ide/user/ide/guide/code/execution.html) by placing the cursor in the code of interest and press the `Ctrl`+`Enter`. This also works for multiple lines connected by the pipe operator.
- Get [help yourself with R](https://www.r-project.org/help.html) using `help()` function or `?` operator to access function reference manual.
