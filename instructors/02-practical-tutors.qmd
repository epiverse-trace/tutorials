# Practical

This practical has two activities.

## Activity 1: Transmission

Estimate $R_{t}$, _new infections_, _new reports_, _growth rate_, and _doubling/halving time_ using the following available inputs:

- Incidence of reported cases per day
- Reporting delay

Within your room, Write your answers to these questions:

- What phase of the epidemic are you observing? (Exponential growth phase, near peak, or decay end phase)
- Is the expected change in daily reports consistent with the estimated effective reproductive number, growth rate, and doubling time?
- Interpret: How would you communicate these results to a decision-maker?
- Compare: What differences do you identify from other room outputs? (if available)

**Steps:**

- Open the file `02-practical-activity-1.Rmd`.
- Paste the URL link as a string to read input data.
- Keep the reading function that correspond to your input data disease.
- Define a generation time:
    - Access to a generation time, if available, or approximation.
    - Extract distribution parameters or summary statistics.
    - Adap to {EpiNow2} distribution interface.
- Define the delays from infection to case report (observation):
    - For the reporting delay, interpret the description in the `Inputs` section.
    - For the incubation period, steps are similar to generation time.
- Add generation time and delays using the {EpiNow2} helper functions in `EpiNow2::epinow()`.
- Run `EpiNow2::epinow()` and print the summary and plot outputs.
- Paste the outputs. Reply to questions.

### Inputs

| Room | Incidence | Link |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | COVID 30 days | <https://epiverse-trace.github.io/tutorials-middle/data/covid_30days.rds> |
| 2 | Ebola 35 days | <https://epiverse-trace.github.io/tutorials-middle/data/ebola_35days.rds> |
| 3 | Ebola 60 days | <https://epiverse-trace.github.io/tutorials-middle/data/ebola_60days.rds> |
| 4 | COVID 60 days | <https://epiverse-trace.github.io/tutorials-middle/data/covid_60days.rds> |


| Disease | Reporting delays |
|---|---|
| Ebola | The time difference between symptom onset and case report follows a Lognormal distribution with uncertainty. The **meanlog** follows a Normal distribution with mean = 1.4 days and sd = 0.5 days. The **sdlog** follows a Normal distribution with mean = 0.25 days and sd = 0.2 days. Bound the Lognormal distribution with a maximum = 5 days. |
| COVID | The time difference between symptom onset and case report follows a Gamma distribution with uncertainty. The **mean** follows a Normal distribution with mean = 2 days and sd = 0.5 days. The **standard deviation** follows a Normal distribution with mean = 1 day and sd = 0.5 days. Bound the Gamma distribution with a maximum = 5 days. |

5:     Doubling/halving time (days)      -15 (7.5 -- -3.5)
```

#### Interpretation

Interpretation template:

+ From the summary of our analysis we see that the expected change in reports is 
`Likely decreasing` with the estimated new infections, on average, of
`1987` with 90% credible interval of `760` to `4566`.

+ The effective reproduction number $R_t$ estimate (on the last date of the data),
or the number of new infections caused by one infectious individual, on average, is
`0.81`, with a 90% credible interval of `0.43` to `1.30`.

+ The exponential growth rate of case reports is, on average
`-0.047`, with a 90% credible interval of `-0.2` to `0.01`.

+ The doubling time (the time taken for case reports to double) is, on average,
`-15.0`, with a 90% credible interval of `7.5` to `-3.5`.

Interpretation Helpers:

- About the effective reproduction number:
    - An Rt greater than 1 implies an increase in cases or an epidemic. 
    - An Rt less than 1 implies a decrease in transmission, which could lead to extinction if sustained.
- An analysis closest to extinction has a central estimate of:
    - Rt less than 1
    - growth rate is negative
    - doubling or halving time negative, which indicate a decline in cases
- However, given the uncertainty in all of these estimates,
there is no statistical evidence of extinction if the 90% credible intervals of:
    - Rt include the value 1,
    - growth rate include the value 0,
    - doubling or halving time include the value 0.

**From table**:

  - The values from the `summary()` output correspond to the latest available date under analysis.
  - The `Expected change in reports` categories (e.g., `Stable` or `Likely decreasing`)
    describe the expected change in daily cases based on the posterior probability that Rt < 1.
    Find the tutorial table at:
    <https://epiverse-trace.github.io/tutorials-middle/quantify-transmissibility.html#expected-change-in-reports>

**From figure**:

  - The estimate of `Reports` fits the input incidence curve.
  - The forecast of `New infections` and `Reports` per day assumes no change in the reproduction number. For that reason,
    the forecast section of "Effective reproduction no." is constant.
  - About delays:
      - When we include in `delays` the function `EpiNow2::delay_opts()` with both the **incubation** and **reporting** delay, 
          - In Reports, the forecast credible intervals increases.
          - In New infections per day, uncertainty is expanded due to the length of delays.
      - For example: Using the same input data as reference, COVID 30 days: In Reports, the upper interval increases from 30k to 45k. In New infections per day, uncertainty expands from Mar 16 onwards.
  - From comparing COVID and Ebola outputs:
      - The finite maximum value of the **generation** time distribution define the range of the `Estimate based on parial data`.
      - Both values are defined by default by {EpiNow2} using a percentile of 99%
          - COVID: `max` = ~14 days,
          - Ebola: `max` = ~45 days.
      - For this reason, Ebola 35 days has no `Estimate` but only `Estimate based on partial data` and `Forecast`.

## Activity 2: Severity

Estimate the _naive CFR (nCFR)_ and _delay-adjusted CFR (aCFR)_ using the following inputs:

- Reported cases (aggregate incidence by date of onset)
- Onset to death delay

Within your room, Write your answers to these questions:

- What phase of the epidemic are you observing? (Exponential growth phase, near peak, or decay end phase)
- Does the time series include all the possible deaths to observe from known cases?
- How much difference is there between the nCFR and aCFR estimates?
- Interpret: How would you communicate these results to a decision-maker?
- Compare: What differences do you identify from other room outputs? (if available)

**Steps:**

- Open the file `02-practical-activity-2.R`.
- Paste the URL link as a string to read input data.
- Fill in the argument to plot an incidence curve.
- Evaluate if the input data format needs adaptation to {cfr}.
- Access to the probability distribution for the delay from case onset to death.
- Evaluate if you need to keep dates or omit using `dplyr::filter()`.
- Estimate the naive and delay-adjusted CFR.
- Paste the outputs. Reply to questions.

| mers | delay density | 0.138 | 0.072 | 0.229 |


#### Interpretation

Interpretation template:

- As of `15th June 2015`, the MERS cases in the population have a delay-adjusted case fatality risk of `13.8%` with a 95% confidence interval between `7.2%` and `22.9%`.

Intepretation helpers:

- For COVID, until the end of February (on March 1st), the aCFR central estimate is closer to the CFR estimates on April 15th.
- The MERS incidence curve seems to be in a decay phase. However, it is expected to have death reports in upcoming dates, as observed in the COVID Diamond Princess data.
- For MERS, the aCFR estimate is almost the double of the nCFR estimate.

Complementary notes:

- `cfr::static()` assumption and limitations
    - One key assumption of `cfr::static()` is that reporting rate and fatality risk is consistent over the time window considered.
    - Early data from national surveillance systems had limitations (e.g., limited testing, changing case definitions, often only most severe being tested -a.k.a., preferential assessertainment-). So neither method (aCFR nor nCFR) gives the ‘true’ % of fatal symptomatic cases.
    - Compared to the Diamond Princess data, for national surveillance systems `cfr::static()` is therefore most useful over longer timeseries. 
    - Alternativelly, `{cfr}` can also estimate the proportion of cases that are ascertained during an outbreak using `cfr::estimate_ascertainment()`.
